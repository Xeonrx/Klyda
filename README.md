The Klyda project has been created to aid in quick credential based attacks against online web applications.<br />
Klyda supports the use from simple password sprays, to large multithreaded dictionary attacks.

Klyda is a new project, and I am looking for any contributions; including wordlists contributions. Any help is very appreciated.

## Configuration
Klyda offers simple, easy to remember usage; however, still offers configurability for your needs:
- Mulithreaded tasks
- Combine wordlists for larger scale attacks
- Blacklisting data to narrow down hits
- Limit thread speed for sneaky purposes
- Alter requests, such as useragent, timeout, & headers
- File output
